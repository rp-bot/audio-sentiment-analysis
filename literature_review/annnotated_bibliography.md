# Annotated Bibliography

## [1. AST Audio Spectrogram Transformer](AST_Audio_spectrogram_transformer.pdf)

-   CNN-Attention hybrid model
-   overall this paper informs about the current state of audio deep learning

## [2. Automatic Music Emotion Classification](Automatic_music_emotion_classification.pdf)

-   uses a basic CNN
-   they carry out multiple experiments
-   architecture is of interest in this paper
-   Dataset is also quite interesting

## [3. PANNs](PANNs_Large-Scale_Pretrained_Audio_Neural_Networks.pdf)

-   Very Interesting take on CNNs
-   Dataset is of interest in this paper

## [4.Robust Speech Emotion Detection](A_Robust_Speech_Emotion_Detection_Mechanism_Using_Supervised_Deep_Learning_Paradigms.pdf)

-   The algorithms and optimizations are quite interesting in this.
-   Their method for getting a spectrogram is also very cool
-   they compare models to prove that their proposed model is better.
